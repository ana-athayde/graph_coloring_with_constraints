# Graph Coloring With Constraints
The project is a multi-objective genetic algorithm to solve the graph coloring problem with additional constraints.

The method involves representing explosive materials arranged in a graph, where some connections between these materials may result in explosions. 

Additionally, there are constraints on storing materials at specific heights. 

The algorithm aims to minimize the colors needed to color the materials while maximizing the diversity of materials stored at permissible heights. 

The implementation includes dynamic features to handle interference between materials and penalties to avoid explosions and ensure keeping the height restrictions. 

This project provides a solution for optimizing the safe arrangement of explosive materials in a restricted environment.
